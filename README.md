A process is an executing instance of an application, for example, double-clicking on the Internet browser icon on the desktop will start a process than runs the browser. A thread is an active flow of control that can be activated in parallel with other threads within the same process. The term "flow control" means a sequential execution of machine instructions. Also, a process can contain multiple threads, so starting the browser, the operating system creates a process and begins executing the primary threads of that process. Each thread can execute a set of instructions (typically, a function) independently and in parallel with other processes or threads. However, being the different active threads within the same process, they share space addressing and then the data structures. A thread is sometimes called a lightweight process because it shares many characteristics of a process, in particular, the characteristics of being a sequential flow of control that is executed in parallel with other control flows that are sequential. The term "light" is intended to indicate that the implementation of a thread is less onerous than that of a real process. However, unlike the processes, multiple threads may share many resources, in particular, space addressing and then the data structures.

Let's recap:
* A process can consist of multiple parallel threads.
* Normally, the creation and management of a thread by the operating system is less expensive in terms of CPU's resources than the creation and management of a process. Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more heavyweight tasksâ€”basically, the execution of applications.
* The threads of the same process share the address space and other resources, while processes are independent of each other.
